## About

This repository demonstrate the concept of Face recognition, specificly, Face client library for JavaScript. The Face service provides you with access to advanced algorithms for detecting and recognizing human faces in images.

>> Verification is one-to-one matching that takes two faces and returns whether they are the same face, and identification is one-to-many matching that takes a single face as input and returns a set of matching candidates. Face recognition is important in implementing the identity verification scenario, which enterprises and apps can use to verify that a (remote) user is who they claim to be.
